                <p>
                    I’m a passionate final-year IT student with a love for solving problems through code.
                    I’ve built a range of projects using Java, C#, JavaScript, SQL, and React — including
                    a personal portfolio website and desktop/web applications. I enjoy bringing ideas to
                    life through clean, functional design and solid development practices. Working 
                    towards more opportunities where I can learn from real-world challenges and grow 
                    as a developer. Outside of tech, I’m a true petrolhead who loves cars, speed, and everything automotive.
